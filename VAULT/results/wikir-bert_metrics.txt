Query : Astrology is a pseudoscience that claims to divine information about
Rank 1: 1845604 [] - The dispositor is a planet in whose sign another planet is located in the natal chart and which resident planet gains strength when its dispositor is also strong The dispositor is the planet which is the ruler of the sign or house that is occupied by any another sign or house lord Western astrology looks upon planetary dispositors as the final response to the meaning of an aspect in a horoscope and it prefers drawing up of Dispositor trees that assist in determining in the Natal Chart the temporal status and the active nature of all planets The concept of Planetary dispositors is not new to Hindu astrology the ancient Hindu texts on Hindu predictive astrology have described numerous yogas based on this principle In fact most yogas are dependent upon the benefic placement of the dispositors of the planets giving rise to those yogas In Hindu astrology the Planetary dispositor is also known as the Poshaka meaning the Nourisher because it tends to aid the occupant of its sign or house Whether the planet occupying a particular sign and bhava will act as a benefic or a malefic also depends upon its dispositor acting as a benefic or a malefic If the sign and the navamsa of the dispositor are both strong then they add to the strength of the resident planet The result of the aspect of the dispositor on its own occupied sign or house or on any other planet depends upon its own basic nature and its acquired strength and qualities Dispositors tend to give results of planets which are occupying their signs they carry the tendencies of those planets The Sun Saturn Rahu and the lord of 12th house possess separatist tendencies in respect of marriage partnership etc their dispositor will also carry the same separatist tendencies where ever it be situated the role of dispositors in conjunctions and aspects is important and cannot be ignored The status acquired by dispositors of Sahams the sensitive points in the Varshaphala charts is equally important The Saham that is aspected by its dispositor or a benefic prospers or if the dispositor aspects the lagna but not so when the aspecting planet is itself weak in strength or occupies the 6th the 8th or the 12th house The signs the planets happen to occupy are vital for determining friendship between planets and their dispositors When no planet occupies its own sign then all planets so placed create a continuous flow of energy from one to the other In the formation of Dhvaja yoga each of the seven planets Rahu and Ketu excluded strong and alone are in another’s sign with one of them situated in the Lagna In the case of sthanaparivartana mutual exchange of signs that gives rise to a powerful yoga two dispositors arise who then act as partners which one is stronger depends upon their individual Awastha Particularly in the case of the two lunar nodes Rahu and Ketu if the dispositor is strong and unafflicted then good results can be expected the lunar nodes give results according to the nature and disposition of the lord of the sign and the house they occupy Moreover if the dispositor of either Rahu or Ketu does not own an evil house i.e the 6th the 8th or the 12th or is not a functional malefic by virtue of owning the 3rd or the 11th and is a benefic for the ascendant then these two Chaya grahas give good results The dispositor governs the planet that happens to occupy its sign a by becoming the sahayogi partner of that yogi whose dispositor it is and b by acting as a proxy for the latter Take the case of the formation of Pushkala yoga the lord of the sign occupied by the Moon associated with the Lagna occupies a kendra or is in the house of an intimate friend and the Lagna is also occupied by a powerful planet in which event the dispositor of the Moon adds strength to the Moon and through the Moon to the Lagna Sreenatha yoga arises when the exalted lord of the 7th house occupies the 10th and the lord of the 10th joins the lord of the 9th in the 10th house thereby favourably strengthening and exciting the 9th and the 10th bhavas/houses If the lord of the sign occupied by the debilitated planet is in a kendra position from the Moon or the Lagna or if the lord of the sign occupied by the debilitated planet aspects that debilitated planet Neechabhanga Raja yoga arises The dispositor of the lord of the navamsa occupied by any planet too plays a pivotal role in yoga-formations In the case of the formation of the favourable Gauri yoga the lord of the navamsa occupied by the lord of the 10th should be exalted in the 10th combined with the lord of the Lagna and in the case of equally favourable Bharati yoga the lord of the navamsa occupied by the lords of the 2nd 5th and the 11th should be exalted and combine with the lord of the 9th Parijata yoga also known as Kalpadrum yoga arises if the dispositor of the lord of lagna and the dispositor of the dispositor or the lords of the navamsas occupied by these two attain exaltation either in a kendra or a trikona
Rank 2: 387626 [] - A round is a process in a planetary chain according to which a life cycle or life-wave of souls or monads begins its evolutionary journey on the first and most subtle or spiritual of the series of seven globes then finishing its evolution there proceeds to the next and so on to the densest or most manifest globe usually called globe D which in our case is the gross physical Earth From there it proceeds on the ascending arc through increasingly more ethereal globes Each of these globes are in coadunition with the physical earth though they are not in consubstantiation with it Each of these stages is called a round and during this time the reincarnating life wave has passed through seven Root Races When the life wave has gone through all seven globes of the planetary chain it has completed one planetary round or globe manvantara This is followed by the dissolution of the planetary chain in a nirvana which is not the same as what Buddhism calls nirvana because it is not permanent this period between physical manifestation is called pralaya in Hinduism Finally a new round begins in which consciousness is now more developed than in the preceding round Seven such planetary rounds or forty-nine globe rounds represents one kalpa or manvantara or day of Brahma This is followed by a higher nirvana or pralaya which is the pralaya of that planetary chain This lasts until a new planetary chain forms with its various life waves Seven such planetary chains and their pralayas constitute a solar manvantara after which the solar system is dissolved in a cosmic pralaya before the cycle begins anew This elaborate cosmology first formulated by Blavatsky was also taught by de Purucker Leadbeater and Alice Bailey Rudolf Steiner retained the basic concept of root races and sevenfold cycles within cycles but his description is considerably simpler concentrating only on the seven cycles of the present Solar System Each of these cycles constitutes a coming into being and passing out of being of the solar system and each is divided into seven rounds upon which man passes through seven root races Each of Steiner's seven rounds is related to a metamorphosis of the Earth For Steiner the animal vegetable and mineral kingdoms represent cast off elements of the human entity from previous rounds These teachings have been incorporated into the Anthroposophical Society that Steiner founded According to Max Heindel's Rosicrucian writings about the scheme of evolution in the beginning of a Day of Manifestation a certain collective Great Being God limits Himself to a certain portion of space in which He elects to create a Solar System for the evolution of added self-consciousness In God there are contained hosts of glorious Hierarchies and lesser beings of every grade of intelligence and stage of consciousness from omniscience to an unconsciousness deeper than that of the deepest trance condition During the current period of manifestation these various grades of beings are working to acquire more experience than they possessed at the beginning of this period of existence Those who in previous manifestations have attained to the highest degree of development work on those who have not yet evolved any consciousness The period of time devoted to the attainment of self-consciousness and to the building of the vehicles through which the spirit in man manifests is called Involution The succeeding period of existence during which the individual human being develops self-consciousness into divine omniscience is called Evolution Every evolving being has within him a force within which makes evolution not to be a mere unfoldment of latent germinal possibilities but a process where each individual differ from that of every other This force called Epigenesis provides the element of originality and gives scope to the creative ability which the evolving being is to cultivate that he may become a God Heindel states that in the Solar system God's Habitation there are seven Worlds differentiated by God within Himself one after another These Worlds have each a different measure and rate of vibration and are not separated by space or distance as is the earth from the other planets They are states of matter of varying density and vibration as are the solids liquids and gases of the physical Earth These Worlds are not instantaneously created at the beginning of a day of Manifestation nor do they last until the end The evolutionary scheme is carried through five of these Worlds in seven great Periods of manifestation during which the evolving virgin spirit becomes first human and then a God The highest Worlds are created first and as involution is to slowly carry the life into denser and denser matter for the building of forms the finer Worlds gradually condense and new Worlds are differentiated within God to furnish the necessary links between Himself and the Worlds which have consolidated In due time the point of greatest density the nadir of materiality is reached From that point the life begins to ascend into higher Worlds as evolution proceeds That leaves the denser Worlds depopulated one by one When the purpose has been served for which a particular World was created God ends its existence which has become superfluous by ceasing within Himself the particular activity which brought into being and sustained that World
Rank 3: 153432 [] - It is sometimes spelled Pancanga Panchanga Panchaanga or Panchānga and is pronounced Panchānga Pachangas are used in Jyotisha In Eastern India including Assam Bengal Odisha the Panchangam is referred to as Panjika Panchāngams are published in India by many authors societies academies and universities Different publications differ only minutely at least for a casual or not yet trained reader They forecast celestial phenomena such as solar eclipses forecasting weather rain dry spells as well as more mundane occurrences The study of Panchāngams involves understanding Rasi phala also pronounced Rashi phala the impact of the signs of the zodiac on the individual Astrologers consult the Panchāngam to set auspicious dates for weddings corporate mergers and other activities as per their religion The casting of a Panchāngam involves elaborate mathematical work involving high level of spherical geometry and sound understanding of astronomical phenomena such as sidereal movements of heavenly bodies However in practice the tabulation is done on the basis of short-cut formulations as propounded by ancient Vedic sages and scholars William James American Author From the Vedas we learn a practical art of surgery medicine music house building under which mechanized art is included They are encyclopedia of every aspect of life culture religion science ethics law cosmology and meteorology Emmelin Plunret in Calendars and Constellations They were very advanced Hindu astronomers in 6000 BC Vedas contain an account of the dimension of Earth Sun Moon Planets and Galaxies Historian Will Durant noted It is true that even across the Himalayan barrier India has sent to the west such gifts as grammar and logic philosophy and fables hypnotism and chess and above all numerals and the decimal system A typical Panchāngam may state tabulations of positions of Sun Moon and other planets for every day of the year on a fixed place longitude latitude and time of day in 24-hour format IST The users calculate the remaining data using their relative difference from this fixed place and time There are several panchāngas that contain information for more than one year There is one Vishvavijaya Panchāngam that covers 100 years The theories propounded in the two scriptures Surya Siddhanta and Grahalaghava formed the basis for the myriad calendars or Panchāngas in the past in different regions of India The Grahalaghava was compiled about 600 years ago and Surya Siddhanta was available long before that These had become outdated and did not tally with actual astronomical events and did not tally with each other Hence a committee was appointed by the Government of India with experts in the field drawn from various parts of the country who were involved with preparation of Panchāngam in local languages to draw up a reliable Panchāngam in which the mathematical calculations provides the positions of grahas the planets and nakshatras constellations in the sky as they are observed Thus the Government of India has prepared the National Panchānga or the Indian national calendar in 1957 was proposed by Saha and Lahiri in 1952 which is used in predictive astrology The Lahiris Ephemeris published annually is the most widely used English almanac in Vedic astrology many Panchāngas are published in local languages which are mostly based on the National Panchānga Accuracy of attributes depending upon the Moon's motions were considered most crucial for the reliability of a panchāngam because the Moon is the fastest among all heavenly entities shown in traditional panchāngas Tithi Nakshatra Rāśi Yoga and Karana depend upon Moon's motions which are five in number Panchānga is a Sanskrit word literally meaning having five limbs If these five limbs for example the five attributes depending upon Moon are accurate an almanac is held to be reliable because other elements are not so difficult to compute due to their slow rates of change There are three popular meanings of panchāngam In Vedic astrology the basic tenet of astrology was integrated with celestial events and thus was born various branches of Vedic astrology and the Panchānga In simple terms “ Panchānga” means the Day Nakshatra Star Thithi Yoga and Karana every day It is a mirror of the sky The document used as Panchāngam has evolved over the last 5000 years The theories propounded in the two scriptures Surya Siddhanta and Grahalaghava formed the basis for the plethora of calendars or Panchāngas in the past in different regions of the country a culturally complex system The five Angas or parts of Panchāngam are elaborated in the following paragraphs but before that the composition of the Samvatsara OR Years 60 Years cycle Varsha or Year and Masa or month are first explained as these important calendar events are part of every Panchānga All the components of Panchangam are relevant in Predictive Astrology Prasna Shastra electional astrology etc All followers and practitioners of Vedic astrology must know how to read a Panchāngam and in this context it is necessary to know the terminology used in the Panchāngam for different time slots of the day Panchāngas are also published in English as Ephemeris The Lahiris Ephemeris is most widely used which gives all the details as contained in a traditional Panchāngam published in Sanskrit or Hindi and all the regional languages of the country There are several forms of reckoning the varsha or year based on solar entry solar ingress lunar entry Jupiter entry in a sign or the Julian calendar of starting the year from the first of January but the most widely accepted practice in India is the Samvatsara a 60 years cycle based on solar entry Each zodiacal sign is represented by fixe years starting from Pramadi and the sixty years are equally distributed in successive order among the twelve signs Rasis starting from Mesha Aries and ending in Meena Pisces Varsha or the year used in astrological context refers to the solar calendar of year and months which starts with Sun entering Aries Mesha Rasi and completing a full circle of the zodiac in a period of twelve months There are two kinds of lunar months followed in India the new moon ending called the Amanta or Sukladi system and the full moon ending covering one full moon to the next called the Purnimanta system But it is the lunar months full moon reckoned which are reckoned in predictive astrology and each represents the name of the star on full moon day of the solar months The twelve lunar months starting from Chaitra along with the names of the solar months are given below In Vedic astrology the basic tenets of astrology were integrated with celestial events with vara or weekday and thus was born the Muhurtha astrology or electional astrology Thithi or Lunar day is an important concept in Hindu astrology It means lunation There are thirty thithis in a Lunar month distributed in the 360 degrees of the Zodiac and each thithi is completed when the longitude of the Moon gains exactly twelve degrees or its multiple on that of the Sun By name there are only 15 thithis repeating in the two halves of the month – Shukla 1 to Shukla 15 known as Poornima or Full Moon and Krishna 1 to 15 known as Amavasya or New Moon In astrological parlance Thithi has great significance in the fact that each Thithi from 1 to 14 in both Pakshas has what are called daghda rasis or burnt rasis – two rasis for each thithi except Chaturdasiwhich has four daghda rasis But new moon and full moon have no dagdha rasis The thithis are divided into five groups as under A unique Vedic system is followed in Muhurtha astrology Horary astrology and predictive astrology which envisages grouping of Nakshtaras stars into nine sub-groups Each sub-group covers three stars and has a specific name of ‘Tara’ proceeded by a word defining benefic or malefic nature These are found to be extremely useful in Vedic astrology which is widely practiced in India The nine taras star groups by their individual names are listed below The basic purpose of Hindu Panchāngam is to check various Hindu festivals and auspicious time election Muhurta In the Hindu system of election various element of Panchāngam constitute auspicious and inauspicious moments Yogas by combination of weekday-Tithi weekday-constellation weekdays-Tithis-constellations In addition individual weekdays Tithis constellations Yoga and Karanas have been prescribed for specific activities which fructify during their currency For selecting an auspicious moment Panchāngam Shuddhi purified-time is fundamental In addition favourable transits purified ascendant absence of malefic yogas favourable Dasha Hindu progression name of doer propitiations chanting of Mantras place of activity social customs omens mode of breathing are also examined
Rank 4: 38451 [] - Such groups date from the middle of the 20th century some adherents are serious and some are not Those who are serious are often motivated by pseudoscience or conspiracy theories Through the use of social media flat Earth theories have been increasingly espoused by individuals unaffiliated with larger groups many of which have members from around the globe Modern flat Earth belief originated with the English writer Samuel Rowbotham 1816–1884 Based on conclusions derived from the Bedford Level experiment Rowbotham published a pamphlet Zetetic Astronomy He later expanded into a book Earth Not a Globe proposing the Earth is a flat disc centred at the North Pole and bounded along its southern edge by a wall of ice Antarctica Rowbotham further held that the Sun and Moon were 3,000 miles 4,800 km above Earth and that the cosmos was 3,100 miles 5,000 km above the Earth He also published a leaflet titled The inconsistency of Modern Astronomy and its Opposition to the Scriptures which argued that the Bible alongside our senses supported the idea that the earth was flat and immovable and this essential truth should not be set aside for a system based solely on human conjecture Rowbotham and followers like William Carpenter gained attention by successful use of pseudoscience in public debates with leading scientists such as Alfred Russel Wallace Rowbotham created a Zetetic Society in England and New York shipping over a thousand copies of Zetetic Astronomy After Rowbotham's death Lady Elizabeth Blount established a Universal Zetetic Society whose objective was the propagation of knowledge related to Natural Cosmogony in confirmation of the Holy Scriptures based on practical scientific investigation The society published a magazine The Earth Not a Globe Review and remained active well into the early 20th century A flat Earth journal Earth a Monthly Magazine of Sense and Science was published between 1901–1904 edited by Lady Blount In 1956 Samuel Shenton created the International Flat Earth Research Society as a successor to the Universal Zetetic Society running it as organising secretary from his home in Dover England Given Shenton's interest in alternative science and technology the emphasis on religious arguments was less than in the predecessor society When satellite images showed Earth as a sphere Shenton remarked It's easy to see how a photograph like that could fool the untrained eye Later asked about similar photographs taken by astronauts he attributed curvature to the use of wide-angle lens adding It's a deception of the public and it isn't right In 1969 Shenton persuaded Ellis Hillman a Polytechnic of East London lecturer to become president of the Flat Earth Society but there is little evidence of any activity on his part until after Shenton's death when he added most of Shenton's library to the archives of the Science Fiction Foundation he helped to establish Shenton died in 1971 Charles K Johnson inherited part of Shenton's library from Shenton's wife and established and became president of the International Flat Earth Research Society of America and Covenant People's Church in California Over the next three decades under his leadership the Flat Earth Society grew to a reported 3,500 members Johnson issued many publications and handled all membership applications The most famous publication was Flat Earth News a quarterly four-page tabloid Johnson paid for these publications through annual member dues costing US$6 to US$10 over the course of his leadership Johnson cited the Bible for his beliefs and he saw scientists as pulling a hoax which would replace religion with science The Flat Earth Society's most recent planet model is that humanity lives on a disc with the North Pole at its centre and a 150-foot 45 m high wall of ice Antarctica at the outer edge The resulting map resembles the symbol of the United Nations which Johnson used as evidence for his position In this model the Sun and Moon are each 32 miles 52 km in diameter Flat Earth Society recruited members by speaking against the US government and all its agencies particularly NASA Much of the society's literature in its early days focused on interpreting the Bible to mean that the Earth is flat although they did try to offer scientific explanations and evidence Eugenie Scott called the group an example of extreme Biblical-literalist theology The earth is flat because the Bible says it is flat regardless of what science tells us According to Charles K Johnson the membership of the group rose to 3,500 under his leadership but began to decline after a fire at his house in 1997 which destroyed all of the records and contacts of the society's members Johnson's wife who helped manage the membership database died shortly thereafter Johnson himself died on 19 March 2001 In 2004 Daniel Shenton not related to Samuel resurrected the Flat Earth Society basing it around a web-based discussion forum This eventually led to the official relaunch of the society in October 2009 and the creation of a new website featuring a public collection of flat Earth literature and a wiki Moreover the society began accepting new members for the first time since 2001 with musician Thomas Dolby becoming the first to join the newly reconvened society over 500 people have become members In 2013 part of this society broke away to form a new web-based group also featuring a forum and wiki Flat Earth Society of Canada was established on 8 November 1970 by philosopher Leo Ferrari writer Raymond Fraser and poet Alden Nowlan and was active until 1984 Its archives are held at the University of New Brunswick Calling themselves planoterrestrialists their aims were quite different from other flat Earth societies They claimed a prevailing problem of the new technological age was the willingness of people to accept theories on blind faith and to reject the evidence of their own senses The parodic intention of the Society appeared in the writings of Ferrari as he attributed everything from gender to racial inequality on the globularist and the spherical Earth model Ferrari even claimed to have nearly fallen off the Edge of the Earth at Brimstone Head on Fogo Island Ferrari was interviewed as an expert in the 1990 flat Earth mockumentary In Search of the Edge by Pancake Productions a reference to the expression as flat as a pancake In the accompanying study guide Ferrari is outed as a globularist a nonce word for someone who believes the Earth is spherical The real intent of the film which was part-funded by the Ontario Arts Council and National Film Board of Canada was to promote schoolchildren's critical thinking and media literacy by attempting to prove in convincing fashion something everyone knew to be false Multi-media artist Kay Burns re-created the Flat Earth Society of Canada as an art project with her alter ego Iris Taylor as its president Burns created an installation entitled the Museum of the Flat Earth which included some artifacts from the 1970 group It was exhibited in 2016 at the Flat Earth Outpost Café in Shoal Bay Newfoundland In Italy there are no centralized societies on flat Earth However since the 2010s small groups of conspiracy theorists who carry out meetings started to emerge and to spread flat Earth theories Among these are Calogero Greco Albino Galuppini and Agostino Favari who organized in 2018-2019 several meetings in Palermo Sicily with an entry price of €20 Among their claims some include In addition to these it is their common belief that United States has a plan to create in Europe a new America open to everyone where the only value is consumerism and that George Soros commands a satanic globalist conspiracy They reject the past existence of Dinosaurs the Darwinian evolution theory and the authority of the scientific community claiming scientists are masons Former leader of the Five Star Movement political party Beppe Grillo showed interest in the group admitting to admire their free speech spirit and to want to participate the May 2019 conference In the end however Grillo did not appear In the Internet era the availability of communications technology and social media like YouTube Facebook and Twitter have made it easy for individuals famous or not to spread disinformation and attract others to their erroneous ideas One of the topics that has flourished in this environment is that of the flat Earth Modern flat-Earthers generally embrace some form of conspiracy theory out of the necessity of explaining why major institutions such as governments media outlets schools scientists and airlines all assert that the world is a sphere They tend to not trust observations they have not made themselves and often distrust or disagree with each other Based on the speakers at the 2018 UK's Flat Earth UK Convention believers in a flat Earth vary widely in their views While most agree upon a disc-shaped Earth some are convinced the Earth is diamond-shaped Furthermore while most believers do not believe in outer space and none believe mankind has ever traveled there they vary widely in their views of the universe The solar eclipse of 21 August 2017 gave rise to numerous YouTube videos purporting to show how the details of the eclipse prove the Earth is flat Also in 2017 the Tunisian and Arab scientific and educational world had a scandal when a PhD student submitted a thesis declaring Earth to be flat unmoving young only 13,500 years of age and the centre of the universe On 3 May 2018 Steven Novella analyzed the modern belief in a flat Earth and concluded that despite what most people think about the subject the believers are being sincere in their belief that the Earth is flat and are not just saying that to wind us up He stated that The British skeptical activist Michael Marshall attended the UK's annual Flat Earth UK Convention on 27–29 April 2018 and noted disagreement on several views of the believers in a flat Earth To Marshall one of the most telling moments at the convention was the Flat Earth Addiction test that was based on a checklist used to determine whether someone is in a cult without the convention attendees realizing the possibility of themselves being in a cult Organizations skeptical of fringe beliefs have occasionally performed tests to demonstrate the local curvature of the Earth One of these conducted by members of the Independent Investigations Group at the Salton Sea on 10 June 2018 was attended also by supporters of a flat Earth and the encounter between the two groups was recorded by the National Geographic Explorer This experiment successfully demonstrated the curvature of the Earth via the disappearance over distance of boat-based and shore-based targets Mike Hughes a daredevil and flat-Earth conspiracy theorist used a homebuilt manned-rocket in an attempt to see for himself if the Earth is flat on 24 March 2018 His rocket made of scrap metal was estimated to cost 20,000 and using a mobile home as a custom launchpad managed to climb 1,875 feet with Hughes inside and ended with a hard landing but with parachutes successfully deploying The amateur rocketeer was not seriously injured and remains firm in his flat Earth beliefs He claims that real evidence will come with larger rockets
Rank 5: 1416030 [] - The instrument consists of three rings representing the celestial equator declination and the meridian It can be used as a sun dial to tell time if the approximate latitude and season is known or to tell latitude if the time is known or observed at solar noon It may be considered to be a simplified portable armillary sphere or a more complex form of astrolabe Parts of the instrument go back to instruments made and used by ancient Greek astronomers Gemma Frisius combined several of the instruments into a small portable astronomical-ring instrument He first published the design in 1534 and in Petrus Apianus's Cosmographia in 1539 These ring instruments combined terrestrial and celestial calculations Fixed astronomical rings are mounted on a plinth like armillary spheres and can be used as sundials The dial is suspended from a cord or chain the suspension point on the vertical meridian ring can be changed to match the local latitude The time is read off on the equatorial ring in the example below the center bar is twisted until a sunray passes through a small hole and falls on the horizontal equatorial ring A sunring or farmer's ring is a latitude-specific simplification of astronomical rings On one-piece sunrings the time and month scale is marked on the inside of the ring a sunbeam passing through a hole in the ring lights a point on this scale Newer sunrings are often made in two parts one of which slides to set the month they are usually less accurate In 1610 Edward Wright created the sea ring which mounted a universal ring dial over a magnetic compass This permitted mariners to determine the time and magnetic variation in a single step The three rings are oriented with respect to the local meridian the planet's equator and a celestial object The instrument itself can be used as a plumb bob to align it with the vertical The instrument is then rotated until a single light beam passes through two points on the instrument This fixes the orientation of the instrument in all three axes The angle between the vertical and the light beam gives the solar elevation The solar elevation is a function of latitude time of day and season Any one of these variables can be determined using astronomical rings if the other two are known The altitude of the sun does not change much in a single day at the poles where the sun rises and sets once a year so rough measurements of solar altitude don't vary with time of day at high latitudes When the solar time is exactly noon or known from another clock the instrument can be used to determine the time of year The meridional ring can function as the gnomon when the rings are used as a sundial A horizontal line aligned on a meridian with a gnomon facing the noon-sun is termed a meridian line and does not indicate the time but instead the day of the year Historically they were used to accurately determine the length of the solar year A fixed meridional ring on its own can be used as a which can be read only at noon When the shadow of the rings are aligned so that they appear to be in the same or nearly the same place the meridian identifies itself The meridian ring is placed vertically then rotated relative to the celestial object until it is parallel to the local north-south line The whole ring is thus parallel to the circle of longitude passing through the place where the user is standing Because the instrument is often supported by the meridional ring it is often the outermost ring as it is in the traveller's rings illustrated above There a sliding suspension shackle is attached to the top of the meridional ring from which the whole device can be suspended The meridional ring is marked in degrees of latitude 0–90 for each hemisphere When properly used the pointer on the support points to the latitude of the instrument's location This tilts the equatorial ring so that it lies at the same angle to the vertical as the local equator The equatorial ring occupies a plane parallel to the celestial equator at right angles to the meridian It is aligned by Often equipped with a graduated scale it can be used to measure right ascension On the traveller's sundial shown above it is the inner ring This ring is sometimes engraved with the months on one side and corresponding zodiac signs on the outside very similar to an astrolabe Others have been found to be engraved with two twelve-hour time scales Each twelve-hour scale is stretched over 180 degrees and numbered by hour with hashes every 20 minutes and smaller hashes every four minutes The inside displays a calendrical scale with the names of the months indicated by their first letters with a mark to show every 5 days and other marks to represent single days On these the outside of the ring is engraved with the corresponding symbols of the zodiac signs The position of the symbol indicates the date of the entry of the sun into this particular sign The vernal equinox is marked at March 15 and the autumnal equinox is marked at September 10 The declination ring is moveable and rotates on pivots set in the meridian ring An imaginary line connecting these pivots is parallel to the Earth's axis The declination ring of the traveller's sundial above is not a ring at all but an oblong loop with a slider for setting the season This ring is often equipped with vanes and pinholes for use as the alidade of a dioptra see image It can be used to measure declination This ring is also often marked with the zodiac signs and twenty-five stars similar to the astrolabe
Rank 6: 1633851 [] - In the analysis of planetary lines in astrocartography the rising setting Imum coeli and midheaven lines of the LAP represent geographic areas of greatest potential for the native The theory was initially developed by analyzing accurately recorded horoscopes of historical personalities and it has also been successfully applied in mundane astrology to the study of historical events The complete text of this research was made available as a free e-book in 1998 and many excerpts of it were later published in online and print journals over the next decade The essay The Role of the Least-Aspected Planet in Astrocartography New Insights Into the Spirit of Place which introduced these ideas was featured in Matrix Software's Learn Astrology archive originally Astro-Talk magazine later that same year In 2000 the Jim Lewis Slayden Foundation devoted to the legacy of the founder of modern astrocartography Jim Lewis hosted an essay by Couteau titled The Least-Aspected Planet in Astro*Carto*Graphy A Metaphor of the Soul which discusses how the LAP symbolizes the “overall archetypal pattern” residing “at the very core of the chart” and cites Carl Jung as a primary influence The University Centre for Astrological Research C.U.R.A in Paris published two more essays on the subject Couteau's An Introduction to Astrocartography with an introduction in French by Patrice Guinard and Beyond the Trigger Effect A Personal Note on the ‘Numinous Consciousness.’ The latter work explores the writing of Rudolf Otto the scholar of comparative religion who first coined the term numinous and it attempts to link Otto's ideas on religious experience to traditional astrology and Least-Aspected Planets This essay was later translated into Spanish by Gerry Hache and published in C.U.R.A as Mas allá del efecto disparador In 2002 the Finnish astrology magazine Astro Logos published Couteau's lengthy essay Transcendental Mercury as a two-part feature in its summer and fall print editions translated as “Transsendenttinen Merkurius” The essay describes the various ways that Mercury may manifest as either a Least or Most-Aspected Planet in astrology and astrocartography In 1999 Anima Mundi magazine hosted his essay “Transcendental Mars,” which explores the same dynamics in the Martian complex and lists various celebrity personalities with a Least-Aspected Mars whose life and work was epitomized by the symbolism and astrocartographic proximity of that planet In 2004 excerpts from Couteau's work on Least and Most-Aspected Pluto were published in the book The Astrology of Film The Interface of Movies Myth and Archetype by Bill Streett and Jeffrey Kishner In October 2006 The Mountain Astrologer featured a review of the complete text of The Role of the Least-Aspected Planet in Astrocartography Planetary Symbolism in Astrocartography and Transcendental Astrology Other print magazines that have featured Couteau's work on the subject include Astrolore The Astrology Magazine published in Poole England and the Celtic Astrologer The Journal of the Dublin Astrological Centre In 1999 in the summer and fall editions of Aspects magazine astrologer Claudia Dikinis published a two-part article titled “Election 2000” that cited Couteau's statistical findings namely that Least-Aspected Saturn appears with higher frequency than other horoscope planets in the birth charts of American presidents
Rank 7: 621558 [] - Luminary means source of light The sun and moon being the most abundant sources of light to the inhabitants of Earth are known as luminaries The astrological significance warrants the classification of the Sun and Moon separately from the planets in that the Sun and Moon have to do with Man's spiritual consciousness while the planetary influences operate through the physical mechanism The Moon is a luminary in the biblical sense that it affords to Man light by night Some early Pre-Newtonian astronomers to observe and study luminaries include Pythagoras Aristotle Claudius Ptolemy al-Khwarizmi Nicolaus Copernicus Tycho Brahe Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler The Sun and Moon were considered the rulers of day and night in accordance with the doctrine of astrology of sect diurnal or daytime planets which were ruled by the Sun and nocturnal or nighttime planets which were ruled by the Moon The Sun was also the sect ruler—or the luminary of sect for all charts of events and individuals born in the daytime when the Sun was over the horizon and the Moon was the sect ruler or luminary of sect for night charts when the Sun was below the horizon Ancient astrologers divided all astrological factors into day and night groups essential dignities Arabian Parts or Lots and all planetary characteristics Even each of the Starry planets themselves belonged to one luminary or the other The luminary in charge of any given chart was called the luminary of sect See sect The luminaries can be found in the Bible In modern Western astrology the importance of the Moon and the Sun has even come to outweigh all the other celestial factors In the interpretation of chart data In Hindu astrology the Moon and the Ascendant have that distinction In the early history of all people we find the Sun and Moon regarded as human beings connected with the daily life of mankind and influencing in some mysterious way man's existence and controlling his/her destiny We find the luminaries alluded to as ancestors heroes and benefactors who after a life of usefulness on this earth were transported to the heavens where they continue to look down on and in a measure rule over earthly affairs The basis of mythology is the worship of the solar great father and the lunar great mother For centuries people have worshiped and regarded the luminaries as objects of higher powers Oftentimes the sun and moon have been considered as opposite sexes For example the sun being the father and the moon being the mother In Australia the Moon was considered to be a man the Sun a woman who appears at dawn in a coat of red kangaroo skins Shakespeare speaks of the Moon as she while in Peru the moon was regarded as a mother who was both sister and wife of the Sun The sex of each has been disputed and thought of differently over the centuries This confusion in the sex ascribed to the Sun and Moon by different nations may have arisen from the fact that the day is mild and friendly hence the Sun which rules the day would properly be considered feminine while the Moon which rules the chill and stern night might appropriately be regarded as a man On the contrary in equatorial regions the day is forbidding and burning while the night is mild and pleasant Applying these analogies it appears that the sex of the Sun and Moon would by some tribes be the reverse of those ascribed to them by others climatic conditions being responsible for the confusion Also many cultures believe the sun and moon to be husband and wife or brother and sister From the conception that the Sun and Moon were husband and wife many legends concerning them were created chief among these being the old Persian belief that the stars were the children of the Sun and Moon As common with many marriages it was also thought that the sun and moons marriage was an uneasy one There are many legends of the sun and moon that relate their disputes and marital troubles for mythology reveals that as husband and wife the Sun and Moon did not live happily together some of these explaining the reason of seasons and weather The myths and thoughts of the relationship between the sun and moon and their role in the universe are high in quantity Correlations and connections can be made with some of these beliefs but oftentimes many disagree with others In early modern England the medical effects of the sun and the moon had been traditionally explained by a vast symbolic system of analogies correspondences and relations among apparently discrete elements in man and the universe which had its conceptual origins in the works of Aristotle Ptolemy and Galen The ultimate causes of planetary emanations had been considered occult an Aristotelian and early modern term utilized when distinguishing qualities which were evident to the senses from those which were hidden After the Restoration many physicians attempted to rid the natural world of occult causes and to explain invisible forces like solar and lunar emanations via mechanical chemical and mathematical systems To explain the medical effects of the luminaries the English physicians Richard Mead 1673-1754 and James Gibbs d 1724 utilized iatromechanism which regarded the body as a Cartesian machine conforming in its functions to mechanical laws Physiological phenomena could thus be explained in terms of physics Richard Mead subsequently applied Newton's gravitational theories to Pitcairne's hydraulic iatromechanism and astrological medicine In De imperio solis ac lunae in corpora humana et morbis inde oriundis A treatise concerning the influence of the sun and moon on human bodies and the diseases thereby produced 1704 Mead stressed the mechanical effects of solar and lunar emanations especially the gravitational effects of the tides on the pressure of vessels and fluids within the human body
Rank 8: 1488556 [] - Indeed Edgar Cayce a devout Christian professed that the position of the planets at birth records the time spent by the souls on other planets or perhaps their spiritual counterparts in between incarnations Some karmic astrologers have professed they can read the person's karma in a Natal chart by studying in particular Lunar nodes and retrograde planets Other astrologers such as Dane Rudhyar's protégé Alexander Ruperti have lectured that everything in the Natal Chart is karmic Both benevolent acts and selfishly motivated acts eventually come back to us as good and bad karma respectively This could be in the same lifetime or perhaps several hundred years down the line Karmic astrology is the science of discerning as accurately as possible through the positions of planets in your birth/divisional chart the reasons why you are the way you are and why you act the way you do It also provides you guidance to resolve past life situations so as to wipe your slate clean and make room for more positive karma in your current lifetime The Karmic planetary positions are divided into five parts Sun The Planet Sun tells about your life’s purpose since it is a soul planet so it will indicate about your weaknesses fears rational thinking etc Your Karmic life purpose weaknesses fears Moon The Planet Moon symbolizes the memory of our Karmic Past detailed analysis of the Moon will clear all your unresolved past issues Memories of your Karmic past unresolved past life issues that have been re-simulated Saturn In general context the planet Saturn is famous for creating troubles and issues but the Karmic substances says that the planet Saturn judges your Karma and provides fruits accordingly But at times it will stand as a stumbling block as well Your Karmic Stumbling blocks Rahu Do you know that planet Rahu is the root cause of Karma and without Rahu one cannot perform Karma internally or externally Your Karmic roots Ketu You may be aware of the importance of planet Ketu which is called a spiritual planet it is the planet which guides us about our Karmic Path and makes us follow positive path that leads you towards a beautiful and comfortable life Your Karmic Path Apart from all this actually Vedic Folks will analyze your birth chart about your Karma or action and Karmic factors also along with the 5th 9th houses and their lords would also be analyzed for getting exact and transparent results
Rank 9: 21 [] - They observe astronomical objects such as stars planets moons comets and galaxies – in either observational by analyzing the data or theoretical astronomy Examples of topics or fields astronomers study include planetary science solar astronomy the origin or evolution of stars or the formation of galaxies Related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole Astronomers usually fall under either of two main types observational and theoretical Observational astronomers make direct observations of celestial objects and analyze the data In contrast theoretical astronomers create and investigate models of things that cannot be observed Because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form evolve and die They use these data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial objects work Further subcategories under these two main branches of astronomy include planetary astronomy galactic astronomy or physical cosmology Historically astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws Today that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms astronomer and astrophysicist are interchangeable Professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a PhD in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities They spend the majority of their time working on research although they quite often have other duties such as teaching building instruments or aiding in the operation of an observatory The number of professional astronomers in the United States is actually quite small The American Astronomical Society which is the major organization of professional astronomers in North America has approximately 7,000 members This number includes scientists from other fields such as physics geology and engineering whose research interests are closely related to astronomy The International Astronomical Union comprises almost 10,145 members from 70 different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the PhD level and beyond Contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night it is far more common to use a charge-coupled device CCD camera to record a long deep exposure allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time Before CCDs photographic plates were a common method of observation Modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year Analysis of observed phenomena along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe takes the majority of observational astronomers time Astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes Most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes planetariums as a public service to encourage interest in the field Those who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths sciences and computing in high school Taking courses that teach how to research write and present papers are also invaluable In college/university most astronomers get a PhD in astronomy or physics While there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers the field is popular among amateurs Most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties The Astronomical Society of the Pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations Like any hobby most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research However amateurs span the range from so-called armchair astronomers to the very ambitious who own science-grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research
Rank 10: 273936 [] - Natal astrology can be found in the Indian or Jyotish Chinese and Western astrological traditions In horoscopic astrology an individual's personality is determined by the construction of the horoscope or birth chart for the particular individual involved known as the native showing the positions of the sun moon planets ascendant midheaven and the angles or aspects among them Once the horoscope has been constructed the process of interpretation can begin which involves building a complete picture of the personality of the subject or native Interpretation involves three main steps noting the important features of the chart and the processes of chart weighting and chart shaping Chart weighting involves noting the distribution of zodiac signs and houses in the chart and the significance of this to the overall personality of the native Chart shaping involves assessing the placement of the planets by aspect and position in the chart and noting any significant patterns which occur between them Astrology is generally considered a pseudoscience by the scientific community What little statistical evidence exists fails to show a causation between natal birth charts and real world consequences The important features of every chart that the astrologer must give special attention to are the positions of the sun and moon by sign and house the sign on the ascendant and the planet that rules that sign called the ascendant ruler or chart ruler Also important is the first planet to occupy the first second or third houses after the ascendant Called the rising planet it will be particularly strong in the chart If no planet occupies the first three houses then a planet in the twelfth house close to the ascendant can be taken to be the rising planet Planets that are in conjunction to right beside the primary angles of ascendant midheaven descendant or IC known as angular planets must also be especially considered Chart weighting begins by listing the sun moon planets ascendant and midheaven by categories of sign and house and noting the significant categories which appear For example a large number of planets appearing in fire signs will give importance or weight to fire sign attributes in the native's personality Chart weighting by sign lists the zodiac signs by three main categories by masculine or feminine signs by element fire earth air and water and by quality cardinal fixed and mutable Some astrologers use all ten or eleven planets in the list and nothing else while others include the ascendant and midheaven but exclude the modern planets Uranus Neptune and Pluto on the grounds that their influence is felt by whole generations and so their position by sign cannot have much significance in the individual chart Some astrologers summarise the process of weighting by sign through creating what is called the chart signature This involves noting which element and quality has the most signs and then combining them into a zodiac sign which is taken to be the signature sign of the chart So for example if a person has more fire signs than any other element and more fixed signs than any other quality then that person's signature is Leo the sign which is both fire and fixed In some cases there is no clear majority in either element or quality to give a clear signature In these cases the ruling planet of the sun is noted for its position in the chart alternatively the ascendant can be added at this stage if it has not already been included Whatever sign the ruling planet occupies is then added to the totals for element and quality So for example if the Sun is in Taurus its ruling planet Venus is noted for its position by sign If Venus is in say Pisces then an additional casting vote is given to the element water and quality mutable This is usually enough to provide a signature A casting vote is given in this way on account of the extra importance of the Sun in the natal chart The signature sign is regarded by those astrologers who use it as frequently having an over-riding influence in the natal chart irrespective of what sign the sun or ascendant occupies Chart shaping involves examining the placement of the planets in the chart by the aspects they form and by their positioning in the chart relative to one another Any significant patterns or shapes which occur in the chart are then interpreted for their importance to the personality of the native While the astrologer must note every aspect formed by the planets aspects can be grouped together into larger patterns which must be given particular attention in the chart The main aspect patterns are as follows The houses are grouped into four main categories or hemispheres Horoscopes appear upside down in relation to how the compass points usually appear with the ascendant marking the eastern horizon traditionally appearing on the left hand side For this reason the southern hemisphere appears in the upper part of the horoscope The American astrologer Marc Edmund Jones has listed seven significant patterns which also occur in the chart based on the positions of the planets relative to one another Shawn Carlson's double-blind chart matching tests in which 28 astrologers agreed to match over 100 natal charts to psychological profiles generated by the California Psychological Inventory CPI test is one of the most renowned tests of astrology The experimental protocol used in Carlson's study was agreed to by a group of physicists and astrologers prior to the experiment Astrologers nominated by the National Council for Geocosmic Research acted as the astrological advisors and helped to ensure and agreed that the test was fair The scientist and former astrologer Geoffrey Dean and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted a large scale scientific test involving more than one hundred cognitive behavioural physical and other variables but found no support for astrology Furthermore a meta-analysis was conducted pooling 40 studies consisting of 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts Ten of the tests which had a total of 300 participating involved the astrologers picking the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others which were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation usually 3 to 5 others When the date and other obvious clues were removed no significant results were found to suggest there was any preferred chart A further test involved 45 confident astrologers with an average of 10 years experience and 160 test subjects out of an original sample size of 1198 test subjects who strongly favoured certain characteristics in the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire to extremes The astrologers performed much worse than merely basing decisions off the individuals age and much worse than 45 control subjects who did not use birth charts at all In 1955 astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin stated that although he had failed to find evidence to support such indicators as the zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology he had found positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some of the planets and success in professions such as doctors scientists athletes actors writers painters etc which astrology traditionally associates with those planets The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the Mars effect A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim but found no statistical evidence They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study Geoffrey Dean has suggested that the effect may be caused by self-reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin The suggestion is that a small subset of the parents may have had changed birth times to be consistent with better astrological charts for a related profession The sample group was taken from a time where belief in astrology was more common Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in more recent populations where a nurse or doctor recorded the birth information The number of births under astrologically undesirable conditions was also lower indicating more evidence that parents choose dates and times to suit their beliefs
