the first election to fill the newly created office of lieutenant governor The candidates for governor and lieutenant governor were joined together as a single choice so that voters did not have the opportunity to split the ticket Kim Guadagno Christie's running mate will be New Jersey's first lieutenant governor The following three candidates all qualified to appear and did appear in the debates Nine other candidates qualified to appear on the ballot as independents or third-party nominees but did not raise enough money to qualify for the debates These include Libertarian Kenneth Kaplan the Socialist Party USA's Greg Pason and the following independents Jason Cullen Joshua Leinsdorf Alvin Lindsay David R Meiswinkle Kostas Petris Gary T Steele and Gary Stein At least five others including popular New Jersey comedian Uncle Floyd announced that they would run write-in campaigns The following candidates were defeated by Jon Corzine in the Democratic primary The following candidates were defeated by Chris Christie in the Republican primary The following Republican Primary candidates were removed from the ballot Former U.S Attorney Christopher J Christie had long been considered the front-runner for the Republican nomination He was heavily favored by the party establishment and had won the endorsement and county line of all county GOP organizations Christie's chief opponent in the primary was former Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan known for his very right-wing positions and vocal opposition to the Corzine administration another staunch conservative General Assemblyman Rick Merkt was also on the ballot David Brown Christian Keller and Franklin Township mayor Brian D Levine also filed to run in the Republican primary but their petitions were challenged by Lonegan and they were disqualified from the ballot when administrative judges ruled that their nominating petitions failed to meet the threshold of 1,000 valid signatures Upon leaving the race Brown and Levine endorsed Christie Christie and Lonegan attacked each other relentlessly throughout the primary campaign through mailers and robocalls with each seeking to undermine the other by drawing the public's attention to scandals involving the other Lonegan proposed ending the state's progressive income tax system and replacing it with a 2.9 flat tax for all New Jerseyans Christie strongly opposed this proposal arguing that Lonegan's proposal would amount to a tax increase for most New Jerseyans Christie instead proposed cutting taxes across the board although he refused to say by how much There were two televised debates which excluded Merkt and two radio debates which included him Ultimately Christie was able to win the primary with 55 of the vote to Lonegan's 42 and Merkt's 3 Although polls indicated his vulnerability in the general election Governor Jon S Corzine was heavily favored to win the Democratic primary over his three little-known challengers The only one of those to have held elected office former Glen Ridge mayor Carl Bergmanson was running on a platform of fiscal discipline social liberalism and government reform he had received the support of the Citizens Against Tolls website In the primary Corzine won renomination with 77 of the vote while Bergmanson his closest competitor received about 9 Since the primaries polls have consistently showed Christie leading Corzine sometimes by double digits The election became a three-way race on July 7 when independent candidate Christopher Daggett announced that he had raised enough money to qualify for public funds and to qualify for participation in the debates On July 20 Christie selected Kim Guadagno as his running mate On July 24 Corzine announced in an e-mail to his supporters that he had selected Loretta Weinberg as his running mate On July 27 Daggett announced that he had selected longtime Kean University professor and administrator Frank J Esposito as his running mate Although the economy and taxes have long been prominent issues in the campaign the issue of ethics and anti-corruption efforts was thrust into the spotlight in July when several public officials were arrested on corruption charges in Operation Bid Rig One of Corzine's main lines of attack has involved Christie's ties to the unpopular former President of the United States George W Bush who appointed Christie to the U.S Attorney's office in 2001 In August 2009 Bush political strategist Karl Rove revealed that he had held conversations with Christie about a potential gubernatorial run during Christie's time as U.S Attorney U.S Attorneys are prohibited from engaging in partisan political activities by the Hatch Act of 1939 Corzine quickly incorporated this into his advertisements targeting Christie On November 8 2005 voters

to take office in January 2010 Until the creation of the office governors who died in office or stepped down were succeeded by the President of the New Jersey Senate This has happened twice in recent years with the resignations of Christine Todd Whitman in 2001 and James McGreevey in 2004 Concerns over separation of powers Acting Governors continued to serve concurrently in the Senate and the fact that Acting Governors were not elected by the people to succeed the Governor led to the Constitutional amendment that created the new office All 12 candidates for governor appearing on the ballot selected their running mates by the June 27 2009 deadline Chris Christie the Republican nominee for governor selected Monmouth Beach's Kim Guadagno the sheriff of Monmouth County as his running mate

Esposito a longtime professor and administrator at Kean University who served as an advisor to the Commissioner of Education in the Thomas Kean Sr administration as his running mate Others mentioned for the post had included Edison Mayor Jun Choi Atlantic County freeholder Alisa Cooper and Passaic County freeholder James Gallagher All 80 seats in the lower house of the legislature the General

Assembly and withdrew from his re-election bid on July 31 Smith was under pressure from the Democratic Party to resign but did not he is not seeking re-election The scandal resulting from the arrests
